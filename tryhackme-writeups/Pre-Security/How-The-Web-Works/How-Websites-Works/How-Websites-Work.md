# Understanding How Websites Work 

## Introduction

When you visit a website, your browser communicates with a web server to fetch information about the page. 

## Key Points
• Your browser (like Safari or Google Chrome) requests page information from a web server. 

• The web server responds with data to help your browser display the page. 

• A website consists of two main parts: 

• Front End (Client-Side) - how a website looks in the browser. 

• Back End (Server-Side) - the server that processes requests and provides responses. 

## Conclusion

Your browser requests data from a server, which helps render the webpage you see.
