# Overview of the Data Link Layer 

## Introduction: 
The data link layer is essential for handling physical addresses in data transmission. 

## Key Points: 

• It receives packets from the network layer, adding the MAC address of the receiving endpoint. 

• Each computer has a Network Interface Card (NIC) with a unique MAC address. 

• MAC addresses are fixed and assigned by the manufacturer, but can be spoofed. 

• The data link layer also formats data for transmission. 

## Conclusion: 
The data link layer plays a critical role in identifying endpoints and preparing data for sending across networks.
