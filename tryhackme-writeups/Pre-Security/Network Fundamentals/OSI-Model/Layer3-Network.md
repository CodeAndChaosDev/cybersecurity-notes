# Third Layer (Network) of the OSI Model 

The third layer of the OSI model, known as the network layer, is responsible for routing and reassembling data from small chunks into larger ones. Routing determines the best path for data to travel. Key protocols like OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) and RIP (Routing Information Protocol) help identify the optimal paths. 

## Factors influencing the chosen route include: 

• The shortest path with the fewest devices. 

• The most reliable path with minimal packet loss. 

• The fastest physical connection type (copper vs. fiber). 

Communication at this layer uses IP addresses, such as 192. 168. 1. 100, and devices like routers are considered Layer 3 devices because they operate at this layer.
