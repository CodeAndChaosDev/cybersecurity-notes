# User Accounts on a Windows System 

## Introduction 
On a local Windows system, user accounts are categorized into two types: Administrator and Standard User. The type of account determines the level of access and actions a user can perform. 

## Key Points 
• Administrator Account: This type allows users to make system-wide changes, including adding or deleting users, modifying settings, and installing software. 

• Standard User Account: Standard users can only modify their personal files and folders but cannot make system-level changes. 

• To see existing user accounts on the system, click the Start Menu and type "Other User," then select the option that appears. As an Administrator, you will see the option to "Add someone else to this PC," which Standard Users will not see. 

• You can view account details by selecting a local user account and clicking "Change account type. " 

• Each user profile is created upon the first login and is stored in the C:\Users folder. For example, the folder for user Max would be C:\Users\Max. 

• During the first login, users may see messages indicating that their profile is being created. 

• Common folders in each profile include Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Music, and Pictures. 

• Another method to access user account information is through Local User and Group Management. To open it, right-click on the Start Menu, select Run, and type "lusrmgr. msc ". 

• In Local Users and Groups, you will find Users and Groups folders, where you can see group names and descriptions. Users can be assigned to multiple groups, inheriting permissions from those groups. 

## Conclusion 
User accounts on Windows have specified roles and permissions, allowing for varying levels of control over system settings and personal profiles.
