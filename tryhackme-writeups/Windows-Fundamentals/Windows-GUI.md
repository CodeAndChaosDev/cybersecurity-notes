# Summary of Windows 10 Desktop and GUI Components 

## Introduction 
The Windows Desktop, also known as the graphical user interface (GUI), is the main screen you see after logging into a Windows 10 computer. Before accessing the desktop, you must log in by entering your username and password. 

## Key Points 

### The Desktop 
• The desktop contains shortcuts to programs, folders, and files, which can be organized in folders or scattered randomly. 

• You can customize the desktop by right-clicking to access a menu that allows you to change icon sizes, arrangement, and create new items like folders and documents. 

• Display settings let you alter the screen resolution and orientation, especially useful for multiple screens. Note that in a Remote Desktop session, some display settings may be disabled. 

• You can change the desktop wallpaper under the "Personalize" option, which also allows changes to fonts and color schemes.
