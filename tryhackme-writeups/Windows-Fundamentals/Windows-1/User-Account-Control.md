# User Account Control (UAC) 

## Introduction 
Many home users operate their Windows systems with local administrator accounts, which allows them to make system changes. However, this elevated access increases the risk of malware infections. 

## Key Points 
• Users do not need administrator privileges for everyday tasks like browsing the Internet or editing documents. 

• Elevated privileges make it easier for malware to compromise the system since it runs with the logged-in user’s permissions. 

• To protect users, Microsoft introduced User Account Control (UAC), starting with Windows Vista. 

• UAC restricts the current session from running with elevated permissions and prompts users for permission when requiring higher-level privileges. 

• The built-in local administrator account does not have UAC applied by default. 

• A shield icon appears on programs when logged in as a standard user, indicating that UAC will prompt for permission to install software. 

• If the user does not enter the password at the UAC prompt, the installation will not proceed. 

## Conclusion 
UAC enhances security by lowering the chances of malware compromising the system. Further information about UAC can be found through Microsoft resources.
