# HTML Injection Overview 

HTML Injection is a security vulnerability that occurs when a website displays unfiltered user input directly on the page. If a site does not sanitize this input, attackers can insert harmful HTML code. 

## Key Points: 

• Input sanitization is crucial for website security, as user input often interacts with frontend and backend processes. 

• An example of another vulnerability is database injection, which allows attackers to manipulate database queries. 

• Control over input allows users to submit their own HTML or JavaScript, affecting the page’s appearance and functionality. 

• Developers should always sanitize user input, such as stripping out HTML tags, to prevent risks. 

## Conclusion: 
Always be cautious with user input to protect against vulnerabilities like HTML injection.
