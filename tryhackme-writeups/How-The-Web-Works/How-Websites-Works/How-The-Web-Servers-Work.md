# How Web Servers Work 

## Introduction 
A web server is software that manages incoming connections and uses the HTTP protocol to provide web content to users. Common web server software includes Apache, Nginx, IIS, and NodeJS. 

## Key Points 
• Web Server Basics: Web servers deliver files from their root directory, which is set in their software. For example, both Nginx and Apache use /var/www/html in Linux, while IIS uses C:\inetpub\wwwroot in Windows. 

• Virtual Hosts: Web servers can host multiple websites using virtual hosts. They check the requested hostname in the HTTP headers, match it with text-based configuration files, and serve the correct website. Each virtual host can point to different locations on the server. 

• Static vs. Dynamic Content: Static content does not change (like images or CSS), whereas dynamic content may change based on different requests (like a blog homepage showing new entries). Dynamic updates are managed by backend processes. 

• Scripting and Backend Languages: Backend languages, like PHP, Python, and Ruby, allow websites to interact with users and databases. An example is using PHP to display personalized greetings based on user input, without showing the code to the user. 

## Conclusion 
Web servers play a crucial role in delivering web content and enabling interactions through dynamic and static content managed by backend languages and scripting.
