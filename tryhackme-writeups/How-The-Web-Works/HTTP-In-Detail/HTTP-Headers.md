# Understanding HTTP Headers 

## Introduction: 
HTTP headers are extra data sent to web servers during requests, which help in proper website viewing. 

## Key Points: 

• Request Headers: Sent from the browser to the server to specify details about the requested site. 

• Host: Identifies the specific website to retrieve from servers hosting multiple sites. 

• User-Agent: Informs the server about the browser type and version for proper site formatting. 

• Content-Length: Indicates the size of data being sent in the request. 

• Accept-Encoding: Lists compression methods supported by the browser for efficient data transmission. 

• Cookie: Stores user information for the server’s recollection. 

• Response Headers: Returned from the server to the browser after a request. 

• Set-Cookie: Provides information to be stored and sent back on future requests. 

• Cache-Control: Defines how long the browser should keep the response content before re-requesting. 

• Content-Type: Specifies the type of data returned, such as HTML or images. 

• Content-Encoding: Describes the compression method used on the data during transmission. 

## Conclusion: 
Headers are important for communication between browsers and servers, ensuring proper website functionality and data handling.
