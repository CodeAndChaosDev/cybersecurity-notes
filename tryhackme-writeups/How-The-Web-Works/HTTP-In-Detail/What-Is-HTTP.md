# What is HTTP and HTTPS? 

## HTTP
HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the protocol used to view websites, created by Tim Berners-Lee and his team from 1989 to 1991. It allows communication with web servers to transmit data like HTML, images, and videos. 

## HTTPS
HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) is the secure version of HTTP. It encrypts data, preventing others from viewing your information, and ensures that you are communicating with the correct web server and not an imposter.
