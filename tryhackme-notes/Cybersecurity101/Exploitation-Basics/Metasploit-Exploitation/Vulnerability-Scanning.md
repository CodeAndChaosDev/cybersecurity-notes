# Metasploit Vulnerability Scanning 

## Introduction: 
Metasploit is a tool used for identifying critical vulnerabilities in systems, often referred to as "low hanging fruit. " These vulnerabilities are easy to find and exploit, which can lead to gaining access to a system or higher privileges. 

## Key Points: 

• To find vulnerabilities effectively with Metasploit, it is essential to scan and fingerprint the target system. Better skills in these areas will yield more options. 

• If a VNC service is detected on the target, you can use Metasploit's search function to explore available modules, particularly scanner modules related to VNC. 

• Example VNC scanning modules include:

• `use auxiliary/scanner/vnc/` 

• `use auxiliary/scanner/vnc/ard_root_pw` 

• `use auxiliary/scanner/vnc/vnc_login`

• `use auxiliary/scanner/vnc/vnc_none_auth` 

• The `info` command on any module provides detailed information on its purpose and usage. 

• The VNC Authentication Scanner (`auxiliary/scanner/vnc/vnc_login`) is designed to check the VNC server across multiple machines and report successful login attempts. It supports various RFB protocol versions and uses challenge-response authentication. 

## Conclusion: 
The vnc_login module is a valuable resource for retrieving login information for the VNC service, enhancing the ability to exploit vulnerabilities identified through Metasploit.
