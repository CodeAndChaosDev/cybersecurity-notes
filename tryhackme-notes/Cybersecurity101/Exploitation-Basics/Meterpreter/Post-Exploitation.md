# Meterpreter Commands 

## Introduction 
Meterpreter is a powerful tool that helps during the post-exploitation phase of penetration testing. It offers various commands to monitor and control the target system. This summary covers some fundamental commands and their usages. 

## Key Points 

Help Command 

• Command: `help` 

• Description: Lists all available commands in Meterpreter. 

## Core Commands 

• ? : Displays the help menu. 

• background (bg): Puts the current session in the background. 

• bgkill: Kills a background Meterpreter script. 

• bglist: Lists running background scripts. 

• bgrun: Runs a Meterpreter script as a background thread. 

• channel: Shows information or controls active channels. 

• close: Closes a specific channel. 

## Important Commands 

• getuid 

• Displays the current user running Meterpreter, indicating privilege level. 

• ps 

• Lists running processes along with their Process ID (PID), which is essential for migrating sessions. 

## Migration 

• Command: `migrate [PID]` 

• Function: Transfers Meterpreter's control to another process for more stability or functionality, such as keylogging. 

• Caution: Be aware of potential privilege loss when migrating to a process with a lower privilege level. 

## Hashdump Command 
• Command: `hashdump` 

• Purpose: Lists contents of the SAM database, which contains hashed Windows user passwords. 

• Notes: Hashes may be cracked using online databases or can be used in Pass-the-Hash attacks to gain access to other systems. 

## Search Command 

• Command: `search -f [filename]` 

• Usage: Finds specific files on the target system, useful in both CTF challenges and real penetration tests for locating sensitive information. 

## Shell Command 

• Command: `shell` 

• Function: Launches a standard command-line shell on the target system. To return to Meterpreter, press CTRL+Z. 

## Conclusion 
Meterpreter provides critical functions for executing commands and gaining further access in a system post-exploitation. Understanding the key commands, such as `help`, `getuid`, `ps`, `migrate`, `hashdump`, `search`, and `shell`, enhances operational effectiveness during penetration testing.
