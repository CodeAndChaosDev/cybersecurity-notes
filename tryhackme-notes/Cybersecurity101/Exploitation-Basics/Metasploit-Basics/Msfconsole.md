# Metasploit Console (msfconsole) Usage 

## Introduction 
The Metasploit Framework is a key tool in cybersecurity for exploiting vulnerabilities. The msfconsole is the primary way to interact with the framework. This summary explains how to start and use msfconsole, including commands and features. 

## Key Points 

1. Starting msfconsole: 

• Launch it by entering `msfconsole` in your terminal. 

• The console will show version info and details about exploits, payloads, and other modules available. 

2. Basic Console Commands: 
• Basic commands like `ls` for listing directory contents and `ping` for testing network connectivity are supported, but some regular command-line features (like output redirection) are not. 

3. Help and History: 

• Use the `help` command for guidance on commands, e. g. , `help set`. 

• `history` shows previous commands typed for easy access. 

4. Tab Completion: 
• Pressing the tab key can help complete commands automatically, improving efficiency. 

5. Context Management: 

• Changes made in modules (like setting options) are lost if you switch to another module unless set globally. 

• Example: Setting parameters for the ms17_010_eternalblue exploit context requires reconfiguration if another exploit is used. 

6. Using Exploits: 

• To use a specific exploit, type `use` followed by the exploit path. 

• Use `show options` to see the parameters that need to be set for the selected exploit. 

7. Payloads and Show Commands: 

• Use `show payloads` within an exploit context to see compatible payloads. 

• You can use `show` followed by a module type to list available modules. 

8. Exiting Context: 

• Use the `back` command to return to the previous context or the main console. 

9. Getting Module Information: 

• The `info` command provides detailed info about a selected module, including its description and options. 

10. Search Functionality: 

• `search` allows you to find modules within the Metasploit Framework using various parameters like CVEs or module names. 

• You can filter results by module type with commands like `search type:auxiliary telnet`. 

11. Exploit Reliability: 
• The reliability of exploits is ranked; however, even low-ranking exploits can function properly while high-ranking ones may fail or cause issues. 

## Conclusion 
The msfconsole is a crucial interface for exploiting vulnerabilities in the Metasploit Framework. Understanding basic commands, context management, and the use of search and info commands can significantly enhance your efficiency in using Metasploit. Always remember that exploitation efforts may lead to unexpected behavior on target systems.
