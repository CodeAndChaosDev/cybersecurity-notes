# Outlook's Email Security Features and Vulnerabilities 

## Introduction 
Outlook is capable of displaying emails as HTML and handling various hyperlinks. It utilizes a security feature known as "Protected View" to protect users from potential threats. 

## Key Points 
• Outlook renders emails as HTML and can parse HTTP and HTTPS hyperlinks, as well as Moniker Links. 

• When an external application is triggered, Outlook's Protected View prompts a security warning, opening certain emails in read-only mode. 

• Users can create hyperlinks using the file:// Moniker Link format to access network files, but Protected View blocks these attempts. 

• Modifying the hyperlink by adding a special character can bypass Protected View, potentially exposing users' credentials to attackers. 

• An attacker can exploit this vulnerability without needing the file share to exist, leading to the transmission of sensitive information. 

• While Remote Code Execution (RCE) is theoretically possible through Moniker Links, there is no public proof of concept available for this specific security issue. 

## Conclusion 
Outlook’s Protected View feature aims to enhance security while handling external links but can be bypassed through specific hyperlink modifications, highlighting the importance of vigilance in email security.
