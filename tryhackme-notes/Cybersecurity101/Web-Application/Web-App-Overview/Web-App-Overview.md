# Components of a Web Application 

## Introduction: 
This content draws an analogy between a web application and a planet, illustrating how users interact with web applications while highlighting the various components involved in their functionality. 

## Key Points: 

1. Front End: 
• The Front End is compared to the surface of a planet, which is what users see when they use a web browser. 

• Key technologies involved are: 

• __HTML__ (Hypertext Markup Language): Basic structure of web pages; analogous to simple organisms on a planet, containing essential instructions like DNA. 

• __CSS__ (Cascading Style Sheets): Enhances the visual appearance of the web application, akin to DNA describing the characteristics of organisms, adding colors and layouts. 

• __JavaScrip__t (JS): Allows for interactive features and decision-making in web applications, comparable to a brain that enables advanced organisms to respond to their environment. 

2. Back End: 

• The Back End consists of hidden components that are vital for the web application’s operation, similar to non-visual aspects of a planet such as air and gravity. 

• Key components include: 

• __Database__: A storage system for information, like a planet's ecosystem that keeps various resources. It holds data like user preferences. 

• __Infrastructure__: Includes servers and networking devices necessary for functionality, analogous to roads and cars on a planet. 

• __Web Application Firewall__ (WAF): Provides security by filtering harmful requests, similar to how a planet’s atmosphere protects it from harmful elements. 

## Conclusion: 
The successful delivery of a web application involves both visible Front End components like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and hidden Back End components such as databases and WAFs. This foundation will be elaborated on in future discussions.
