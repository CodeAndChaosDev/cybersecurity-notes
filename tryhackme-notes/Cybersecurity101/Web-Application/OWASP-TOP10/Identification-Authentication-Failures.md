# Authentication and Session Management in Web Applications 

## Introduction: 
Authentication and session management are vital parts of modern web applications, helping to ensure that only verified users can access their features. 

## Key Points: 
• Authentication verifies a user's identity, usually through a username and password. Once verified, the server issues a session cookie to the user's browser to track their actions. 

• Without proper authentication, attackers can exploit vulnerabilities to access other users' accounts, risking sensitive data. 

• Common authentication flaws include: 

• Brute Force Attacks: Attackers may guess usernames and passwords through repeated attempts.

• Weak Credentials: Allowing weak passwords makes it easy for attackers to gain access. 

• Weak Session Cookies: Predictable session cookie values can be manipulated by attackers to hijack user accounts. 

• Mitigation Strategies: 

• Enforce strong password policies to prevent password-guessing attacks. 

• Implement automatic lockout after several failed attempts to thwart brute force attacks. 

• Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to add an extra layer of security, requiring a second form of verification, which makes unauthorized access more difficult. 

## Conclusion: 
Effective authentication and session management are crucial for protecting user data in web applications, and implementing robust security measures can significantly reduce risks.

# Try Hack Me Challenge

Also a fairly easy challenge.
All we have to do is follow directions. Basically this flaw is due to bad user input sanitization. 
Register with " darren" instead of "darren" allows us to regain access to the user "darren" without his password.

Doing so we get: fe86079416a21a3c99937fea8874b667
Doing the same with arthur we get: d9ac0f7db4fda460ac3edeb75d75e16e

Easy!
