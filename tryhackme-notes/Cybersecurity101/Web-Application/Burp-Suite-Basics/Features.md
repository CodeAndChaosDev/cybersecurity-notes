# Burp Suite Community Features 

Burp Suite Community provides various tools that are beneficial for web application testing, despite having fewer features than the Professional edition. 

## Key Features: 

• Proxy: The Burp Proxy allows users to intercept and modify web requests and responses. 

• Repeater: This feature lets users capture, modify, and resend requests multiple times, which is useful for testing vulnerabilities.

• Intruder: Intruder enables users to send multiple requests to test endpoints, often used in brute-force attacks or fuzzing. 

• Decoder: Decoder transforms data by decoding captured information or encoding payloads, offering a practical solution within Burp Suite. 

• Comparer: Comparer allows for comparing two data pieces at the word or byte level, speeding up the comparison process with direct inputs.
 
• Sequencer: This tool assesses the randomness of tokens, highlighting potential weaknesses in the generation of session cookies or similar tokens. 

Furthermore, the Java codebase allows for the development of extensions in Java, Python, or Ruby. The Burp Suite Extender module facilitates easy loading of these extensions, while the BApp Store provides access to third-party modules, with some requiring a professional license. However, many extensions, like Logger++, are available for Burp Community users.
