# Understanding Digital Traces in Security Investigations 

## Introduction: 
Attackers work carefully to hide their actions, making it challenging for security teams to trace them. However, with effort, these teams can often discover how an attack was carried out and identify the attackers. 

## Key Points: 
• Investigating Physical Crimes: In a scenario where police investigate a stolen locket, traces like damaged doors, collapsed ceilings, footprints, and CCTV footage help identify the thief. 

• Digital Investigations: Similar to physical crime scenes, digital devices also contain traces of attacks, primarily stored in logs. 

• Role of Logs: Logs are digital footprints that capture all system activities, whether normal or malicious, aiding in tracking down actions and identities behind them. 

## Use Cases of Logs: 
1. Security Events Monitoring: Helps detect unusual behavior through real-time monitoring. 
2. Incident Investigation and Forensics: Logs provide detailed information during incidents, assisting in understanding what occurred. 
3. Troubleshooting: Records errors that help diagnose and fix system issues. 
4. Performance Monitoring: Offers insights into application performance. 
5. Auditing and Compliance: Logs establish a record of activities, crucial for audits and compliance.
