# Web Server Log Analysis 

## Introduction 
Websites log user interactions daily, collecting data such as request types, timestamps, and user information. These logs are stored in files on web servers, providing valuable insights into user activity and server performance. 

## Key Points 
• Log File Contents: A log file captures various details about user requests, including: 

• IP Address: The user's unique identifier, e. g. , "172. 16. 0. 1". 

• Timestamp: The exact moment a request is made, e. g. , "[06/Jun/2024:13:58:44]". 

• Request: Specifics of the user's request.

• HTTP Method: Indicates the type of action, e. g. , "GET". 

• URL: The resource being accessed, e. g. , "/". 

• Status Code: Server response codes like "200" for success or "404" for not found. 

• User-Agent: Details about the user's operating system and browser. 

• Manual Log Analysis: Useful command-line utilities in Linux for analyzing logs include: 

• cat: Displays the content of a log file. 

• Example usage: `cat access. log` 

• Combining Logs: You can merge multiple log files into one. 

• Example usage: `cat access1. log access2. log &gt; combined_access. log` 

• grep: Searches for specific strings in log files. 

• Example usage: `grep "192. 168. 1. 1" access. log`, which shows all lines with the specified IP. 

• less: Allows for viewing large log files page by page. 

• Example usage: `less access. log`, navigate with the spacebar for the next page and 'b' for the previous. 

• You can search within the log with `/pattern`. 

## Conclusion 
Web server log files are essential for monitoring user activity and troubleshooting server issues. By using command-line utilities like cat, grep, and less, users can efficiently analyze and manipulate log data to extract meaningful insights.
