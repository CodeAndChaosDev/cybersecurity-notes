# Important Practices in Evidence Acquisition for Digital Forensics 

## Introduction: 
Acquiring evidence in digital forensics is essential and must be done carefully to avoid altering the original data. Different methods are used depending on the digital device. Below are key practices to ensure the integrity of evidence collection. 

## Key Points: 

1. Proper Authorization: 
The forensics team must get permission from the appropriate authorities before gathering any data. Evidence collected without authorization may not be usable in court, as it often contains sensitive information. 

2. Chain of Custody: 
Maintaining a chain of custody document is vital. This document records details such as: 

• Description of the evidence (name, type) 

• Names of individuals who collected the evidence 

• Date and time of collection 

• Storage location of the evidence 

• Access times and individuals who accessed the evidence 

This documentation ensures accountability and preserves the integrity of the evidence for court use. 

3. Use of Write Blockers: 

Write blockers are crucial tools in digital forensics. They prevent any changes to a suspect's hard drive when evidence is being collected, ensuring that timestamps and original data remain untouched. This avoids inaccuracies during analysis.
