# Digital Forensics Process 

## Introduction 
The digital forensics team manages various cases that require different tools and techniques. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) outlines a general process for all cases involving digital forensics, which consists of four main phases. 

## Key Points 

1. Four Phases of Digital Forensics: 
• The process includes Collection, Examination, Analysis, and Reporting. 

2. Collection: 
• This is the first phase where data is collected from various devices at a crime scene, such as computers, laptops, and USBs. 

• It is crucial to ensure that the original data remains untampered and to document the evidence collected. 

3. Examination: 
• Collected data can be vast, requiring investigators to filter it based on relevance. 

• For instance, if media files are collected, only those from a specific date might be needed. 

4. Analysis: 
• In this critical phase, investigators analyze the filtered data and link it with other evidence to draw conclusions relevant to the case. 

5. Reporting: 
• A comprehensive report is created, detailing the methodology of the investigation and findings. 

• This report is presented to law enforcement and executive management and should include executive summaries to cater to different levels of understanding.

6. Types of Digital Forensics: 

• Computer Forensics: Focuses on computers as they are commonly involved in crimes. 

• Mobile Forensics: Investigates mobile devices for evidence like call records and text messages. 

• Network Forensics: Examines network traffic logs, extending the investigation beyond individual devices. 

• Database Forensics: Focuses on investigating data breaches or modifications in databases. 

• Cloud Forensics: Deals with evidence on cloud infrastructure, which can be challenging due to limited access. 

• Email Forensics: Analyzes emails to uncover phishing or fraudulent activities. 



## Conclusion 
Understanding the structured process of digital forensics and its various types is essential for investigating digital crimes effectively. Each phase plays a vital role in ensuring that evidence is collected, examined, analyzed, and reported accurately.
