# Summary of SOC Team Focus 

## Introduction: 
The primary goal of the Security Operations Center (SOC) team is to maintain Detection and Response capabilities within the organization. The team utilizes security solutions to monitor the entire network and systems from a central location, ensuring continuous monitoring for security incidents. 

## Key Points: 

1. Detection: 
• Vulnerabilities: These are weaknesses in software that attackers can exploit. The SOC identifies vulnerabilities in devices, like servers or computers, that need updates to protect the company. 

• Unauthorized Activity: The SOC monitors for instances where attackers may use compromised employee credentials to access company systems, needing quick detection to prevent harm. 

• Policy Violations: The SOC checks for actions that break security rules, such as downloading illegal files or sending confidential information insecurely.

• Intrusions: This involves unauthorized access to systems, such as an attacker exploiting a web application or users getting infected from malicious sites. 

2. Response: 

• After detecting incidents, the SOC supports the incident response team to minimize damage and analyze the root causes. 

## Conclusion: 
A mature SOC operates on three pillars: People, Process, and Technology. The effectiveness of the SOC team relies on skilled professionals, advanced security tools, and structured procedures. Future tasks will explore each pillar’s significance in detail.
