# Incident Response Lifecycle Phase 

## Introduction 
In our study of the incident response lifecycle, we focused on the 'Identification' phase from SANS and 'Detection and Analysis' from NIST. Finding unusual behavior and identifying incidents manually is challenging, and various security solutions can help. 

## Key Points 
• Security Solutions: 

• SIEM: Centralizes logs to identify incidents. 

• AV: Detects known malware and performs regular system scans. 

• EDR: Protects systems from advanced threats and can contain and eradicate them. 

• Incident Procedures: After identifying incidents, it’s important to follow specific steps to investigate the attack's extent, prevent further damage, and resolve the issue. These steps differ based on the incident type, and having guidelines, called Playbooks, is crucial. 

• Playbooks: Playbooks provide comprehensive guidelines for responding to incidents, such as phishing emails, including notifying stakeholders and analyzing the email. 

• Runbooks: These are detailed, step-by-step instructions for executing specific actions during various incidents. 

## Conclusion 
Utilizing these security solutions and structured procedures greatly aids in effective incident response and management.
