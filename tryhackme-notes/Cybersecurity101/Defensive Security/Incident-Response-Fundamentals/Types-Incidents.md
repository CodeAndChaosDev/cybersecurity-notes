#  Different Types of Cyber Security Incidents 

## Introduction 
People often refer to harmful online activities broadly as hacking attempts, but this is too general. Cyber security incidents can vary in type and severity. 

Key Points 
1. True Positive Alerts: When a security team analyzes an alert and determines it is a real threat, it becomes an incident, such as a phishing email potentially containing harmful attachments. 

2. Malware Infections: This refers to harmful software that can damage systems. Most incidents are linked to malware, which can come from different file types like documents or executables. 

3. Security Breaches: These occur when unauthorized individuals access confidential information. They are critical because businesses depend on keeping their data secure and accessible only to authorized individuals. 

4. Data Leaks: These involve unauthorized exposure of confidential information. While attackers may exploit leaks for damage or threats, they can also happen unintentionally through mistakes. 

5. Insider Attacks: These attacks are carried out by individuals within an organization, such as an unhappy employee causing damage on their last day. Insider threats can be particularly dangerous due to the access they have. 

6. Denial of Service Attacks: These attacks overwhelm a system with fake requests, making it unavailable to legitimate users. Maintaining data availability is a key aspect of cyber security. 

## Conclusion 
Each type of incident impacts victims differently. What may be catastrophic for one organization could be less damaging for another, depending on the context. For instance, a data leak might not affect XYZ Corp. significantly, but a Denial of Service attack could lead to substantial losses. Understanding these types of incidents is crucial for effective cyber security management.
