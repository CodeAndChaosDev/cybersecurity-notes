# Processes and Security Alerts on Devices 

## Introduction: 
Computing devices, like laptops and mobile phones, run various processes, which are categorized into interactive and non-interactive. Both types generate events that are logged for monitoring. 

## Key Points: 
• Interactive processes involve user actions, such as playing games or watching videos. 

• Non-interactive processes run in the background and are essential for device operation. 

• These processes generate a large number of events, some of which can indicate harmful activities. 

• Security solutions are designed to analyze these events by ingesting them as logs to identify potential threats. 

• When a harmful activity is detected, the security solution triggers an alert for the security team to review. 

• Alerts can be classified as false positives or true positives: 

• False Positive: An alert raised due to non-harmful activity, such as a system backup that is misinterpreted as suspicious. 

• True Positive: An alert indicating a genuine threat, like a phishing email aimed at a user.

• True positive alerts are often labeled as Incidents, which require further action. 

• Incidents are assessed for their severity, categorized as low, medium, high, or critical based on their potential impact. 

• Prioritizing responses to incidents is crucial for effective security management. 

## Conclusion: 
Understanding the nature of processes and how to handle alerts helps in effectively managing security on devices. Responding to incidents based on their severity is essential for maintaining device security.
