# Importance of SIEM 

## Introduction 
To comprehend the significance of Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), it's crucial to recognize the need for clear visibility of network activities. Networks consist of various components, including endpoints, servers, and websites, all communicating through a router. 

## Key Points 
• Network components generate logs from different sources, which are essential for monitoring.

• Logs can be categorized into two main types: 

1. Host-Centric Log Sources: These logs capture events occurring on or related to the host, such as user file access, authentication attempts, and process activities. 
2. Network-Centric Log Sources: These logs are produced when hosts interact or access the internet, including events like SSH connections, FTP file accesses, and VPN usage. 

• SIEM plays a vital role by managing these logs efficiently. It simplifies the process of tracking and analyzing logs, as devices can generate hundreds of events per second, making manual examination impractical. 

## Importance of SIEM Features 
Key features of SIEM include real-time log ingestion, alerting for unusual activities, 24/7 monitoring, protection against new threats, data insights, and the ability to investigate past incidents.
