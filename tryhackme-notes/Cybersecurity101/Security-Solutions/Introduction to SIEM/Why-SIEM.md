# SIEM in Cyber Security 

## Introduction: 
SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) is crucial for detecting threats within network systems by analyzing collected data. 

## Key Points: 
• SIEM identifies threats and raises alerts when specific thresholds are met, allowing analysts to respond effectively. 

• It is a key part of a Security Operations Center (SOC), beginning by collecting logs to see if events match certain conditions. 

• Common SIEM capabilities include: 

• Correlation of events from various log sources. 

• Visibility into Host-centric and Network-centric activities. 

• Investigation of emerging threats for timely responses. 

• Threat hunting beyond existing detection rules. 

## SOC Analyst Responsibilities: 
• SOC Analysts use SIEM for enhanced network visibility. 

• Their main tasks include monitoring, investigating, tuning rules to reduce false positives, ensuring reporting and compliance, and identifying any network visibility gaps.
