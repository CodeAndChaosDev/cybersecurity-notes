# Firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems 

## Introduction: 
In the previous session on firewalls, we learned how they protect a network by checking incoming and outgoing traffic. Firewalls can deny connections that violate their rules, but additional security is needed to monitor already established connections for malicious activities. 

## Key Points: 
• Firewalls act as protectors at the network's boundary, allowing or denying traffic based on rules. 

• Even with a firewall, attackers can still enter the network using legitimate connections. 

• To detect malicious activities within the network, an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is used.

• An IDS is like surveillance cameras in a building, monitoring traffic for unusual activity. 

• It generates alerts for security administrators when it detects abnormal traffic but does not take action itself. 

## Conclusion: 
Firewalls and IDS work together to enhance network security by preventing and detecting threats effectively.
