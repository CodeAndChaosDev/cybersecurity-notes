# Snort Intrusion Detection System 

## Introduction 
Snort is a popular open-source Intrusion Detection System (IDS) created in 1998. It identifies threats through signature-based and anomaly-based detections, using predefined rule files. Users can adjust these rules to enhance their detection capabilities. 

## Key Points 

• Built-in Rules: Snort comes with pre-installed rule files that identify various attack patterns and can detect malicious traffic. Users can create custom rules to target specific types of network traffic not covered by the default rules. Built-in rules can also be disabled if deemed unnecessary. 

• Modes of Snort: 

• Packet Sniffer Mode: This mode reads and displays network packets without analysis. It aids in network monitoring and troubleshooting, useful for diagnosing network performance issues. 

• Packet Logging Mode: Snort detects network traffic in real-time while also logging it into PCAP files. This mode is valuable for forensic investigations, allowing teams to analyze past traffic for root cause analysis following incidents. 

• Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) Mode: This primary mode monitors network traffic in real time, applying rule files to detect known attack patterns and generate alerts for security teams, essential for proactive threat monitoring. 

## Conclusion 
Snort's most significant function as an IDS operates in NIDS mode, although it can be utilized in the other modes according to specific needs. Understanding these modes helps users maximize the benefits of Snort in their network security strategies.
