# CVE and CVSS in IT Support 

## Introduction 
In an IT help desk role managing numerous client complaints, understanding CVE and CVSS is essential for tracking and prioritizing issues. 

## Key Points 

• CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures): This is a system that assigns a unique identifier to each reported vulnerability. Developed by the MITRE Corporation, each CVE number helps track updates related to specific vulnerabilities in software. The CVE number includes a prefix "CVE," the year of discovery, and arbitrary digits. For example, a CVE number format appears as CVE-2024-9374. 

• Importance of CVE: The CVE database allows for easy access to details regarding discovered vulnerabilities, enabling organizations to take protective measures. 

• CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System): This system assigns a severity score ranging from 0 to 10 for vulnerabilities. A higher score indicates a more severe issue. The scores help prioritize complaints effectively. The CVSS score ranges are categorized as follows: 
• 0. 0-3. 9: Low 
• 4. 0-6. 9: Medium 
• 7. 0-8. 9: High 
• 9. 0-10: Critical 

## Conclusion 
CVE and CVSS are valuable tools in the IT help desk environment, facilitating better tracking and prioritization of IT complaints and vulnerabilities.
