# Vulnerability Scanning Overview 

Vulnerability scanning involves examining digital systems to identify weaknesses. Organizations hold vital information within their digital frameworks and must routinely scan their systems and networks for vulnerabilities. If not addressed, these weaknesses can be exploited by attackers, leading to significant losses. Many regulatory bodies require regular vulnerability scanning to ensure compliance, with guidelines suggesting scans occur quarterly or annually. 

While regular scans are crucial, manually searching for vulnerabilities can be challenging and prone to oversight, especially in larger networks. Fortunately, automated vulnerability scanners are available to streamline this process. Once installed, these tools need only an IP address or network range to initiate scans and generate easy-to-understand reports detailing identified vulnerabilities. 

After vulnerabilities are identified, organizations can address them by applying updates or modifications, known as patches. 

## Types of Vulnerability Scans 

Vulnerability scans can be divided into several categories, primarily: 

1. Authenticated vs. Unauthenticated Scans 

• Authenticated Scans require the host's credentials, offering detailed insights into potential vulnerabilities accessible by attackers with host access. 

• Unauthenticated Scans do not need credentials, identifying vulnerabilities that external attackers may exploit without access to the host. 

2. Internal vs. External Scans 

• Internal Scans are performed within the network, focusing on vulnerabilities that could be exploited after an attacker gains entry. 

• External Scans are conducted from outside the network, targeting vulnerabilities exposed to external attackers. 

## Conclusion

The selection of scan type depends on various factors: authenticated scans are typically used for internal scanning, while unauthenticated scans are more common for external vulnerabilities.
