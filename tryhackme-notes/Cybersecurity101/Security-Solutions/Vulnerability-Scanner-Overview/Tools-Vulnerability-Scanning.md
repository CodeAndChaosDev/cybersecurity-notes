# Vulnerability Scanners 

## Introduction 
Various tools are available for automated vulnerability scanning, each with distinct features. This summary outlines some popular scanners used in the industry. 

## Key Points 
1. Nessus: Developed in 1998 as an open-source project, Nessus became proprietary after its acquisition by Tenable in 2005. It offers extensive scanning options and is popular among large enterprises, available in both free (limited features) and paid versions (advanced features, unlimited scans, and support). It requires on-premises management. 

2. Qualys: Introduced in 1999, Qualys is a subscription-based solution providing continuous scanning, compliance checks, and asset management. It automatically alerts users about vulnerabilities found. It is a cloud-based platform, eliminating the need for physical hardware management. 

3. Nexpose: Created by Rapid7 in 2005, Nexpose is also subscription-based. It continuously discovers network assets, providing vulnerability scans, risk scores based on asset value, and compliance checks. It can be deployed on-premises or in a hybrid model. 

4. OpenVAS: This is an open-source tool developed by Greenbone Security, offering basic features and scanning known vulnerabilities. It is less comprehensive compared to commercial options but is suited for small organizations and individual systems. 

## Conclusion 
Each scanner has unique strengths. When selecting a vulnerability scanner, consider the scope, resources, and depth of analysis required for your digital assets.
