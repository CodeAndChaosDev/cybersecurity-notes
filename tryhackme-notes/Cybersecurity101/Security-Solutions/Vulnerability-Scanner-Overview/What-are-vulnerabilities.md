# Vulnerabilities in Homes and Digital Devices 

## Introduction 
This content compares weaknesses in a home to vulnerabilities in digital devices, emphasizing the importance of addressing these issues promptly. 

## Key Points 

• Living in a house with small holes in the roof represents vulnerabilities that, if left unaddressed, can lead to serious problems, such as water damage, dust, and insects entering the home. 

• The act of repairing these holes is called patching. 

• Digital devices have similar vulnerabilities within their software or hardware that can be exploited by attackers, leading to considerable damage. 

• Unlike physical holes, digital vulnerabilities are often hard to notice and require dedicated effort to identify. 

• The process of addressing these digital vulnerabilities also involves patching, which includes applying fixes to protect the devices. 

## Conclusion 
This room focuses on teaching how to identify vulnerabilities in digital devices, exploring available tools for automating this process, and demonstrating practical application using one of the tools.
