# Adding TLS to SMTP, POP3, and IMAP 
- Similar to adding TLS to HTTP 
- HTTP becomes HTTPS, thus: 
 - SMTP becomes SMTPS 
 - POP3 becomes POP3S 
 - IMAP becomes IMAPS 
- Using these protocols over TLS is like using HTTP over TLS 

## Default TCP Port Numbers for Insecure Versions 
- HTTP: 80 
- SMTP: 25 
- POP3: 110 
- IMAP: 143 

## Default TCP Port Numbers for Secure Versions 
- HTTPS: 443 
- SMTPS: 465 and 587 
- POP3S: 995 
- IMAPS: 993 

- TLS can be added to many other protocols with similar advantages.
