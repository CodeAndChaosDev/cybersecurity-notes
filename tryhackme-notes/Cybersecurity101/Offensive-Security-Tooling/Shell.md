# Shell
## What is a Shell? 

A shell is software that helps users interact with an operating system (OS). It can be a graphical interface but is often a command-line interface, depending on the OS. 

In cybersecurity, a shell typically refers to a session an attacker uses to access a compromised system, letting them run commands and execute programs. This access allows attackers to perform several actions. 

## Key Points: 

• Remote System Control: Attackers can execute commands or software on the target system from a distance. 

• Privilege Escalation: Attackers may try to gain higher access, such as administrative privileges if initial access is limited. 

• Data Exfiltration: They can read and copy sensitive data once they have command access.

• Persistence and Maintenance Access: Attackers can establish continued access through user accounts or backdoor software.

• Post-Exploitation Activities: After gaining shell access, they can deploy malware, create hidden accounts, or delete files. 

• Access Other Systems on the Network: The obtained shell may serve as an entry point for further attacks within the network, a practice known as pivoting. 

The shells discussed later can help achieve various attack objectives.
