# Understanding PowerShell Scripting 

## Introduction: 
Scripting involves writing commands in a text file, called a script, to automate tasks typically performed manually in a shell, like PowerShell. It simplifies operations by allowing computers to execute tasks automatically, which can save time and minimize errors. 

## Key Points: 

• Definition of Scripting: Scripting is like providing a computer with a to-do list, where each line represents a task to be done automatically. 

• Importance of Scripting: As you learn more about shells and scripting, you'll find that scripts are effective tools for managing systems and processing data. 

• Relevance in Cyber Security: Learning to script with PowerShell is essential for all cyber security roles because of its powerful capabilities. 

• Uses for Blue Team Professionals: For roles like incident responders and malware analysts, PowerShell scripts can automate: 

• Log analysis 

• Anomaly detection 

• Extraction of indicators of compromise (IOCs) 

• Reverse engineering of malware and scanning systems for intrusions. 

• Uses for Red Team Professionals: For penetration testers and ethical hackers, scripting in PowerShell facilitates: 

• System enumeration 

• Execution of remote commands 

• Creation of obfuscated scripts to bypass security measures. 

• Benefits for System Administrators: PowerShell scripting helps in: 

• Automating integrity checks 

• Managing system configurations 

• Securing networks, particularly in extensive environments. 

• Invoke-Command Cmdlet: 

• A crucial cmdlet for executing commands on remote systems. 

• Essential for administrators, security engineers, and penetration testers for efficient remote management and task automation across multiple machines. 

Example Usage of Invoke-Command: 

1. Running a Script on a Remote Server: 

`Invoke-Command -FilePath c:\scripts\test. ps1 -ComputerName Server01` 

This runs a local script on a remote computer. 

2. Executing a Command on a Remote Server: 

`Invoke-Command -ComputerName Server01 -Credential Domain01\User01 -ScriptBlock { Get-Culture }` 

This runs a command on a remote computer while authenticating with specific credentials. 

## Conclusion: 
These examples illustrate how Invoke-Command is simple yet powerful for automating tasks on remote computers, enabling users to perform various commands effectively without needing comprehensive scripting knowledge.
