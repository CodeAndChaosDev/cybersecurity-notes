# TCP/IP Model 

## Introduction 
This section introduces the TCP/IP model after discussing the ISO OSI model. TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, created by the Department of Defense in the 1970s. 

## Key Points 
• The TCP/IP model is robust, allowing networks to operate even if parts are down, which benefits military communications. 

• The TCP/IP model layers are structured from top to bottom as follows: 

• Application Layer: Combines the OSI model's application, presentation, and session layers (layers 5, 6, and 7). 

• Transport Layer: Corresponds to layer 4. 

• Internet Layer: Matches layer 3 (formerly the network layer in the OSI model). 

• Link Layer: Aligns with layer 2.

• The mapping between TCP/IP model layers and the ISO/OSI model includes: 

• Application Layer (7) - Protocols like HTTP, FTP, etc. 

• Transport Layer (4) - Protocols like TCP, UDP.

• Internet Layer (3) - Protocols like IP, ICMP. 

• Link Layer (2) - Protocols like Ethernet and WiFi. 

• Some textbooks also include the physical layer, leading to a five-layer model: Application, Transport, Network, Link, and Physical. 

## Conclusion 
Future tasks will focus on the IP protocol in the Internet layer and the UDP and TCP protocols in the transport layer.
