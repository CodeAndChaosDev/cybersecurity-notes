# Sensitive Data Exposure in Websites 

Sensitive Data Exposure happens when a website fails to protect or remove sensitive information in clear text, often found in its frontend source code. 

Websites are built with many HTML tags viewable through "viewing page source. " Developers might mistakenly leave login credentials or hidden links in the code. 

This sensitive data can help attackers gain further access within the web application. To assess security issues, always review the page source code for exposed login credentials or hidden links.
