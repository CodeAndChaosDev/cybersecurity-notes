# HTTP Status Codes 

## Introduction: 
HTTP status codes are messages sent by servers to inform clients about the outcome of their requests. They are categorized into five ranges, each indicating different types of responses. 

## Key Points: 
1. 100-199 - Information Response: These codes indicate that the first part of the request has been received and the client should continue. 
2. 200-299 - Success: This range indicates that the client's request was successful. 
3. 300-399 - Redirection: These codes redirect the client to another resource, which could be a different webpage or site. 
4. 400-499 - Client Errors: These inform the client that there was an error in their request. 
5. 500-599 - Server Errors: These indicate problems on the server-side, suggesting major issues with processing the request.
