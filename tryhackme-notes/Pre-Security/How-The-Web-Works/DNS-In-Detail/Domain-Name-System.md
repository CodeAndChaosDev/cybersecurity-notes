# Understanding DNS and IP Addresses 

## Introduction: 
DNS (Domain Name System) simplifies internet communication by replacing complex numbers with easy-to-remember names. 

## Key Points: 
• Every device on the internet has a unique IP address, similar to a home address. 

• An IP address consists of four sets of numbers (0-255) separated by periods. 

• DNS allows users to remember website names, like tryhackme.com, instead of numerical IP addresses. 

## Conclusion: 
DNS makes accessing websites easier by managing IP address translations to user-friendly names.
