# Layer 6 of the OSI Model 

## Introduction: 
Layer 6 of the OSI model is where data standardization begins. 

## Key Points: 

• Software developers create various email clients, but data handling must remain consistent. 

• This layer translates data between the application layer (Layer 7). 

• Regardless of different email clients, emails must display the same content. 

• Security features like data encryption occur at this layer. 

## Conclusion: 
Layer 6 ensures consistent data handling and security, enabling communication between different applications.
