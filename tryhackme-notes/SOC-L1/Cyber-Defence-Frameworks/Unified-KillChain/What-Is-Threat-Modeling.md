# Threat Modelling in Cybersecurity 

Threat modelling is a structured approach aimed at enhancing the security of systems. It involves several key steps: 

1. Identifying Systems: Determine which systems and applications require protection and their roles, particularly focusing on critical operations and sensitive information. 
2. Assessing Vulnerabilities: Analyze possible weaknesses in these systems and how they could be exploited. 
3. Creating a Security Plan: Develop strategies to secure identified vulnerabilities in the systems and applications. 
4. Implementing Prevention Policies: Establish measures to avoid future vulnerabilities, such as adopting a software development life cycle (SDLC) and training staff on phishing risks. 

Overall, threat modelling helps reduce risks by providing an overview of an organization's IT assets and methods to address vulnerabilities. The UKC framework can support these efforts, while frameworks like STRIDE, DREAD, and CVSS are useful for threat modelling. For more information, visit the “Principles of Security” room on TryHackMe.
