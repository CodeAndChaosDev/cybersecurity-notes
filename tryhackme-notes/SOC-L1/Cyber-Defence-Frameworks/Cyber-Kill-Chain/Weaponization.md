# Weaponization Phase in Cyber Attacks 

## Introduction: 
This content discusses the actions of an attacker, referred to as "Megatron," during the weaponization phase of a cyber attack. It explains different concepts related to malware and the techniques used by attackers. 

## Key Points: 
• After reconnaissance, "Megatron" develops a "weapon of destruction" without direct victim interaction, opting for a "weaponizer" that combines malware and exploits.

• Attackers typically use automated tools or buy malware from the DarkWeb, while advanced groups create custom malware to avoid detection. 

• Definitions: 

• Malware: Software designed to harm or access a computer system without authorization. 

• Exploit: Code that takes advantage of vulnerabilities in software or systems. 

• Payload: Malicious code executed on the target system. 

• "Megatron" decides to purchase a pre-made payload from the DarkWeb to focus on other attack phases. 

• In the weaponization phase: 

• Create infected Microsoft Office documents with malicious scripts. 

• Develop sophisticated worms or malware to spread via USB drives. 

• Use Command and Control (C2) techniques to manage victim machines. 

• Select backdoor implants for system access. 

## Conclusion: 
Understanding these tactics and definitions is crucial for recognizing how cyber attacks are structured and executed.
