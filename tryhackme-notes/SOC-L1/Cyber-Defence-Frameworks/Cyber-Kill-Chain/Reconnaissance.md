# Understanding Reconnaissance in Cyber Attacks 

## Introduction: 
Reconnaissance is the initial step an attacker takes to gather information about a target system or victim, serving as a crucial planning phase for their attack. 

## Key Points:

• Definition of Reconnaissance: It involves discovering and collecting information about a victim's system.

• Role of OSINT: Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) is a vital part of reconnaissance, enabling attackers to collect information on a target company and its employees from publicly available resources. This includes data such as the company's size, email addresses, and phone numbers. 

• Example Scenario: An attacker, named "Megatron," wants to conduct a sophisticated attack. He begins by conducting reconnaissance to gather information about potential targets. 

• Email Harvesting: This process involves collecting email addresses from various sources for potential phishing attacks aimed at stealing sensitive data. 

• Tools for Reconnaissance: Some useful tools include: 

• theHarvester: Gathers emails, names, subdomains, IPs, and URLs. 

• Hunter.io: Helps obtain contact information linked to a specific domain. 

• OSINT Framework: A collection of OSINT tools categorized for various uses. 

• Social Media Usage: Attackers may also utilize social media platforms like LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to collect valuable information about their intended targets. 

## Conclusion: 
The reconnaissance phase is critical for attackers as it lays the groundwork for their subsequent actions, emphasizing the importance of information gathering.
