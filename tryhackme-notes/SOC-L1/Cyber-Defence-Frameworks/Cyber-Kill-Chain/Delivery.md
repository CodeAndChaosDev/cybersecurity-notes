# Payload Transmission Methods in Cyber Attacks 

## Introduction: 
In the Delivery phase of a cyber attack, "Megatron" selects how to send malware to targets. Several techniques can be employed to achieve this. 

## Key Points: 
1. Phishing Email: 
Megatron can create a malicious email aimed at a specific individual (spearphishing) or a group within a company. For instance, if he knows Nancy in Sales frequently interacts with Scott from another company, he might send Nancy a fake invoice email using a similar domain to Scott's company. This email would contain the malware. 

2. Infected USB Drives: 
Attackers can distribute USB drives in public areas, such as coffee shops or parking lots. They may print a company logo on these drives and send them like gifts, deceiving the target into plugging them into their computers. 

3. Watering Hole Attack: 
In this method, an attacker targets a specific group by hacking a website they frequently visit. They exploit known vulnerabilities on this site and redirect victims to a malicious page. Victims may unknowingly download malware when visiting this site, sometimes through misleading prompts like fake browser extensions. 

## Conclusion: 
These methods demonstrate various strategies used by attackers to transmit malware, each designed to exploit human interaction or vulnerabilities.
