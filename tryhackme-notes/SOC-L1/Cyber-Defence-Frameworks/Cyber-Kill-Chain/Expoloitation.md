# Attacker Exploitation Techniques 

## Introduction 
This content explains how an attacker exploits vulnerabilities to gain access to systems and move within networks. 

## Key Points 
• An attacker must exploit a vulnerability to gain system access. 

• "Megatron" created two phishing emails: one with a link to a fake Office 365 login page and another with a macro attachment that executes ransomware. 

• The attacker successfully tricked two victims into clicking the malicious link and opening the file. 

• After accessing the system, the attacker can exploit further vulnerabilities to gain elevated privileges or move laterally within the network. 

• Lateral movement involves techniques to access deeper parts of a network to collect sensitive data. 

• A "Zero-day Exploit" is a vulnerability unknown to the public that can cause significant issues before detection. 

## Conclusion 
These methods illustrate how attackers execute exploitation through various techniques, including phishing and exploiting vulnerabilities in systems or human behavior.
