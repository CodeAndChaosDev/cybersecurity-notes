# Victims in Cyber Attacks 

## Introduction: 
In cyber attacks, a victim is the target of an adversary, which can be a person, organization, or digital asset. 

## Key Points: 

• Victims can include email addresses, IP addresses, and domains. 

• It's important to distinguish between victim personae and victim assets for analysis. 

• Victims provide attackers with a chance to infiltrate organizations. 

• An example is a spear-phishing email aimed at a specific individual, who becomes the victim when they click a malicious link. 

• Victim Personae refer to those being targeted, while Victim Assets are the systems and networks exploited by attackers. 

## Conclusion: 
Every cyber attack involves a victim, whose assets are at risk of being compromised.
