# Understanding Adversaries in Cyberattacks 

## Introduction: 
Adversaries, also called attackers or hackers, are individuals or groups behind cyberattacks. They can perform breaches or follow instructions to achieve their goals. 

## Key Points: 
• The Diamond Model defines an adversary as those using specific capabilities against victims for their intentions. 

• Adversary knowledge tends to be unclear at first and may remain unknown during initial attack stages. 

• Distinguishing between adversary operators and adversary customers is crucial for understanding intentions and the relationship between adversaries and victims. 

• An adversary operator is the individual conducting the cyber intrusion.

• An adversary customer benefits from the intrusion and may be the same as the operator or a different group. 

• An example includes an adversary customer managing multiple operators with varied skills. 

## Conclusion: 
Recognizing the roles of adversaries is vital for analyzing cyber threats and responses.
