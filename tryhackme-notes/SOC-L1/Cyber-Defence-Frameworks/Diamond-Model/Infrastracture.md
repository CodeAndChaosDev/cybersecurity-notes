# Infrastructure  

Infrastructure refers to the hardware or software systems that adversaries use to execute their plans and maintain control. This includes physical and logical connections that facilitate their activities, such as command and control centers and data exfiltration. 

## Key Points 
• Infrastructure can include IP addresses, domain names, email addresses, and even malicious USB devices. 

• Type 1 Infrastructure is owned by the adversary. 

• Type 2 Infrastructure is controlled by intermediaries and is used to hide the source of adversarial activities. 

• Intermediary Infrastructure examples include malware servers and compromised emails. 

• Service Providers support both Type 1 and Type 2 Infrastructures, such as Internet Service Providers and domain registrars.
