# IP Addresses and Fast Flux 

## Introduction: 
This content explains the role of IP addresses in networking and their significance in cybersecurity, particularly regarding defense tactics and challenges posed by attackers. 

## Key Points: 
• An IP address identifies devices on a network, including desktops, servers, and CCTV cameras, and is crucial for data transmission. 

• In the Pyramid of Pain, IP addresses are represented by the color green, highlighting their importance in cybersecurity. 

• Knowing an adversary's IP address can aid in defense, allowing for the blocking of hostile inbound requests at firewalls.

• However, this method is not foolproof, as skilled adversaries can simply change their public IP address. 

• Adversaries may employ a technique called Fast Flux to complicate IP blocking. It uses compromised hosts to disguise malicious activities like phishing and malware delivery. 

• A Fast Flux network constantly changes the IP addresses tied to a domain, making it harder for security professionals to trace malicious communication back to the C&amp;C server. 

## Conclusion: 
IP addresses are vital for identifying network devices and enforcing security measures, but techniques like Fast Flux challenge traditional defense methods.
