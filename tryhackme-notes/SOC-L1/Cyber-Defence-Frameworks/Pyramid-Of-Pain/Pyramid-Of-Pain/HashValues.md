# Hash Value and Hashing Algorithms 

## Introduction 
Microsoft defines a hash value as a fixed-length numeric value used to uniquely identify data. It is generated by a hashing algorithm. This summary outlines common hashing algorithms and their relevance in security. 

## Key Points 
1. MD5 (Message Digest 5): 
• Created by Ron Rivest in 1992, it produces a 128-bit hash. 

• MD5 is not cryptographically secure due to vulnerabilities like hash collisions. 

• RFC 6151 issued in 2011 described various attacks on MD5. 

2. SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1): 

• Invented by the NSA in 1995, SHA-1 outputs a 160-bit hash. 

• NIST deprecated SHA-1 in 2011 and banned its use for digital signatures in 2013 due to vulnerabilities. 

3. SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2): 

• Developed by NIST and NSA in 2001 as a replacement for SHA-1. 

• The most commonly used variant, SHA-256, generates a 256-bit hash. 

4. Security Implications: 

• A hash is considered insecure if two files produce the same hash value. 

• Security professionals use hash values to analyze malware and identify malicious files. 

5. Examples and Tools: 

• Security reports often include hashes of malicious files; examples can be found in The DFIR Report and Trellix Threat Research Blogs.

• Tools like VirusTotal and MetaDefender Cloud - OPSWAT are available for hash lookups. 

6. File Modification Impact: 

• Even a minor change to a file alters its hash. For example, appending a string changes the MD5 hash value. 

## Conclusion 
Understanding the various hashing algorithms and their vulnerabilities is crucial for cybersecurity. Hashes help identify and reference malicious files, but file modifications can complicate threat detection.
