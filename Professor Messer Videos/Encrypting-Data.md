# Data Protection and Encryption

- Data protection is essential for information stored on SSDs, hard drives, or any storage devices, necessitating encryption for safeguarding this data.
- The process of encrypting stored data is often referred to as encrypting data at rest, which encompasses not only individual files but potentially all data on a storage device.
- Full disk or volume-level encryption can be utilized, where Windows users may employ BitLocker, while macOS users might use FileVault for similar purposes.
- In certain scenarios, it may be necessary to encrypt specific files rather than entire volumes; Windows users can utilize the Encrypting File System (EFS) for file-level encryption.
- EFS is integrated into the NTFS file system, allowing users to secure data by selecting the option to encrypt contents within the file or folder properties.

## Database Encryption Techniques

- Data stored online, particularly in databases, requires protection through various encryption techniques, including transparent encryption that employs symmetric keys.
- Transparent encryption ensures that data is encrypted and decrypted each time it is accessed from the database, protecting sensitive information while allowing access to non-sensitive data in plain text.
- For instance, in an employee database, sensitive information like Social Security numbers can be encrypted while other data, such as employee names and IDs, can remain unencrypted for easier access.
- Column-level encryption is a strategy that allows certain data fields to be displayed in plain text, thereby reducing overhead during searches while still protecting sensitive information that requires decryption.

## Network Data Encryption

- When transmitting data across networks, encryption is crucial to ensure that any intercepted data remains unintelligible to unauthorized parties.
- Commonly, HTTPS is used in web browsers to encrypt data traversing the network, safeguarding user communications from eavesdropping.
- For connecting different sites or providing remote access, Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) are utilized to create encrypted tunnels for secure data transmission.
- VPNs can use SSL or TLS protocols for client-based connections, while site-to-site connections may utilize Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) for establishing a secure VPN.

## Encryption Algorithms and Compatibility

- Successful encryption and decryption depend on both parties using compatible encryption algorithms, ensuring that the data can be securely transmitted and correctly interpreted.
- Common encryption algorithms include the Data Encryption Standard (DES) and the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), each with distinct methods for processing data.
- DES involves a series of steps to convert plaintext into a 64-bit ciphertext, while AES operates differently by combining plaintext with a secret key to generate ciphertext.
- It is critical to ensure that both parties use the same encryption algorithm, as mismatched algorithms will prevent successful decryption of transmitted data.

## Understanding Encryption Keys

- Encryption algorithms are generally public knowledge, allowing for scrutiny of their workings, but the security of encrypted data fundamentally relies on the secrecy of the keys.
- Just as a door lock requires a key for access, encrypted data requires the correct keys for decryption, emphasizing the importance of keeping these keys secure.
- Keys are susceptible to brute force attacks, where an attacker systematically attempts all possible combinations to discover the key; thus, longer keys enhance security against such attacks.
- A common practice is to use symmetric keys of at least 128 bits, with longer keys becoming necessary as computational power increases over time.

## Key Stretching and Strengthening

- Key stretching is a method used to enhance the security of encryption keys by applying the encryption process multiple times to the same data, making brute force attacks more time-consuming.
- For example, hashing a password multiple times creates layers of encryption that must be decrypted sequentially, adding complexity to the brute force process.
- This technique increases the time required for an attacker to successfully brute force an encrypted key, thereby strengthening overall data security.
