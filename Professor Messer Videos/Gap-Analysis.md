# Introduction to Gap Analysis

- Gap analysis is defined as a study that assesses the difference between the current state and the desired state of an organization, particularly in the context of IT security.
- This process is essential for understanding future security needs and involves evaluating various aspects of IT security within an organization.
- Despite being a straightforward concept, conducting a gap analysis is complex and requires a thorough examination of the current environment.
- The process can take weeks, months, or even years, as it typically involves multiple stakeholders and extensive project planning.
- Gathering information through emails, data collection, and collaboration is crucial for a comprehensive analysis of security practices within the organization.

## Establishing a Baseline

- Before initiating a gap analysis, it is beneficial to establish a baseline which serves as a reference point for evaluating security objectives.
- Different baselines can be utilized, including those developed by reputable organizations such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the International 

## Organization for Standardization (ISO).
- An example of a NIST baseline is the Special Publication 800-171 Revision 2, which focuses on protecting controlled unclassified information in non-federal systems.
- ISO/IEC 27001 is another established baseline that addresses information security management systems.
- Organizations can also create customized baselines tailored to their specific operational needs and security requirements.

## Evaluating Personnel and Processes

- The evaluation phase of the gap analysis involves assessing the personnel within the organization and the security processes they follow.
- Understanding the formal experience and training of staff in information technology security is crucial for identifying strengths and weaknesses.
- It is important to ascertain whether personnel are knowledgeable about existing security policies and procedures that govern the organization.
- Even with qualified personnel, adherence to appropriate IT security policies is essential, starting with a review of current IT systems and their alignment with established security policies.

## Conducting the Analysis

- The analysis phase begins with comparing existing IT systems to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses within the current security framework.
- This analysis also includes comparing identified weaknesses with best practices for mitigating those vulnerabilities.
- A comprehensive analysis involves categorizing security into broad areas and then breaking these down into smaller, more manageable segments.
- For instance, the access control requirements outlined in NIST SP 800-171 can be dissected into specific tasks such as user registration, access provisioning, and management of privileged access rights.
- This systematic breakdown allows organizations to evaluate how effectively they are managing security processes at each level.

## Creating the Gap Analysis Report

- After gathering all relevant information from various processes and devices, a final document summarizing the findings must be created.
- The report should include a comparison of current performance against the established baseline objectives, highlighting the organization's current position versus desired goals.
- Identifying the pathway to transition from the current state to the desired state is critical, as this process often requires significant time, resources, and potential procurement of new equipment.
- The report will also document all recommendations for meeting the baseline objectives, providing a clear strategy for improvement.
- An example of a report table might illustrate system requirements across multiple locations, color-coded to indicate proximity to baseline compliance, with green for compliant, yellow for moderate needs, and red for those requiring significant improvement.

## Implementing Security Controls

- The final gap analysis report will not only summarize current findings but also outline actionable steps for implementing necessary security controls.
- The report will provide a detailed rationale for the color-coding used in the analysis, explaining the basis for each location's categorization and the corresponding security measures needed.
- Organizations are encouraged to prioritize improvements starting with areas marked red, indicating the most urgent security needs, followed by yellow and then green.
- This structured approach ensures that resources are allocated effectively to enhance overall security posture and compliance with established standards.
