# Watering Holes

The video discusses the concept of a “watering hole attack,” a cyber attack strategy exploiting well-trained employees who are resistant to phishing attempts and USB drop attacks. Instead, attackers research third-party websites that employees frequently visit, and they compromise these sites to infect the users who access them. The narrative highlights the necessity for organizations to employ a layered defense mechanism, at times referred to as “defense in depth” to combat such attacks, regardless of the initial training of employees. A notable historical example from January 2017 illustrates how attackers targeted specific financial organizations by compromising relevant websites and serving malicious JavaScript files only to users from certain IP addresses. The video emphasizes the importance of multiple security layers — like antivirus systems, firewalls, and intrusion prevention systems—to ultimately block malicious activity.

## Highlights
🔌 Watering Hole Attack: The strategy where attackers infect third-party sites to access an organization’s network.
🛡️ Employee Training Limitations: Well-trained employees may prevent direct phishing attacks but can still be vulnerable through commonplace third-party sites.
🕵️ Research Requirement: Attackers conduct extensive research to identify and exploit frequented third-party websites.
🌐 Specific Targeting in Attacks: Attackers can infect only selected users from specific organizations via IP address targeting, which mitigates exposure for others.
🕌 Real-World Example: In 2017, a watering hole attack targeted financial authorities in Poland, Mexico, and Uruguay using malicious JavaScript specific to financial entities.
⚙️ Defense in Depth: A multifaceted security approach is essential to thwart such sophisticated attacks, integrating various protective measures.
📊 Layered Security Efficacy: The combination of antivirus and intrusion prevention systems can detect and block potential threats.
Key Insights

🛡️ Layered Security is Crucial: Organizations must not rely solely on employee training. As attackers evolve their techniques, having multiple layers of security (firewall, antivirus, IPS) provides a comprehensive defense. A single point failure can leave significant vulnerabilities.

🔍 Human Error is Inevitable: Despite training, employees can fall prey to unconventional attack methods. The watering hole strategy underscores the need for continuous cybersecurity education, especially regarding safe internet browsing practices.

💻 Proactive Risk Assessment: Companies should conduct regular assessments of their network interactions with third-party sites to identify potential risks. This proactive stance can help isolate vulnerabilities before attackers can exploit them.

🌐 Targeted Exploitation: Cyber attackers can be highly selective about their targets. Tailoring attacks to specific IP addresses of financial institutions shows a keen understanding of network access patterns and the importance of criminal research.

📉 Lack of Transparency: The absence of public knowledge regarding the outcomes of successful watering hole attacks, such as the one in 2017, underlines the difficulties in understanding the full impact of such cyber threats and the urgency to improve threat reporting.

🚨 Dynamic Threat Landscape: Cybersecurity threats are always changing. Organizations need to constantly review and adapt their defense strategies to keep pace with emerging threats.

📈 Regulatory Compliance and Security: Financial institutions, being common targets, must adhere to stringent regulations concerning cybersecurity, making a robust defense against watering hole attacks especially critical in maintaining trust and compliance.
