# Code Injection Attacks

- Code injection attacks are prevalent types of application attacks where attackers insert their own code into the input data processed by an application.
- These attacks are a significant security concern and should not be permitted within applications, necessitating robust preventive measures by developers.
- Developers must implement thorough checks in their code to prevent the injection of unnecessary or malicious application data during standard input operations.
- Various forms of code injection exist, including HTML code injections, SQL injections, and XML injections, among others.

## SQL Injection

- SQL injection, a specific type of code injection, involves the manipulation of SQL queries that an application uses to interact with a database.
- Structured Query Language (SQL) is the standard language for managing and querying relational databases, making it a common target for attackers.
- In a typical SQL injection scenario, an attacker can input their own SQL commands into the application, which can lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of the database.
- If the application lacks proper security checks, attackers can send arbitrary SQL commands to the database, easily exploiting this vulnerability.

## Exploiting SQL Injection Vulnerabilities

- Exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities is often straightforward, as attackers can simply manipulate input fields within the application's user interface.
- An example of a vulnerable SQL query might involve a command that retrieves user information based on a username entered by the user.
- For instance, an attacker could alter a query that normally retrieves data for a specific username to instead request all data from the users table by injecting a condition that is always true, such as '1=1'.
- This manipulation allows the attacker to bypass security measures, potentially granting them full access to the database's contents.

## Impact of SQL Injection

- Successful SQL injection attacks can provide attackers with extensive control over the database, enabling them to view, alter, or delete data at will.
- Attackers can also disrupt the availability of the database, making it inaccessible to legitimate users.
- The repercussions of such attacks can be severe, including data breaches, loss of sensitive information, and damage to the organizationâ€™s reputation.

## Practical Example of SQL Injection

- A practical example involves using an intentionally vulnerable application called WebGoat, which is designed to demonstrate security flaws, including SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- In this scenario, an attacker might input a username and a transaction authentication number into a login form and then inject additional SQL code into those fields.
- By adding a condition that is always true, such as '1=1', the attacker can retrieve all information stored in the database instead of being limited to their specific query.
- This method illustrates how easily an attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive data through SQL injection techniques.
