# Threat Vector Video

The video discusses the concept of threat vectors—methods that attackers utilize to gain unauthorized access to computer systems. It emphasizes the evolving nature of these vectors, as attackers continuously seek both known and unknown means to infiltrate systems. A major focus is on messaging systems like email and SMS, through which phishing attacks are prevalent. Attackers often incorporate malicious links or fraudulent requests within these communications. The video outlines how attackers can exploit various file formats, such as PDFs, to conceal malware, and highlights the dangers of executable files. Additionally, it points out that social engineering techniques are crucial in manipulating individuals into divulging personal information or clicking harmful links. Furthermore, several attack vectors are detailed, including USB drives used for physical infiltration, vulnerabilities in outdated software, and insecure networking practices. The importance of regularly updating software and securing devices against known vulnerabilities is stressed, as attackers can exploit outdated systems to spread malware. Lastly, supply chain vulnerabilities are highlighted as another significant threat, exemplified by the Target data breach, which underscores the risks posed by third-party access to secure systems.

## Threats

📧 Messaging systems are prime attack vectors: Email and SMS are frequently used to initiate phishing attacks.
📂 File formats as potential threats: Formats like PDFs and executables can harbor malware.
⚙️ The role of social engineering: Attackers use manipulation to entice victims into revealing sensitive information or clicking harmful links.
💻 USB drives for physical access: Infiltration can occur through rogue USBs that employees may inadvertently connect to networks.
🔄 Importance of software updates: Regularly updating software helps mitigate risks from unknown vulnerabilities.
🛠️ Supply chain vulnerabilities: Access through third-party vendors exemplified by the Target breach highlights the risks of managed services.
🔐 Securing networks: Ensuring robust and updated security on networks, including using advanced protocols like WPA3, is critical to maintain integrity.
Key Insights

📌 Messaging as a Vulnerability: Messaging platforms (emails and SMS) are relatively easy to exploit, making them prime targets for phishing. Attackers leverage familiarity and trust to manipulate users into clicking malicious links, emphasizing the need for user education on identifying such threats.

🔍 Exploiting File Formats: Various file types can act as vessels for malware, as attackers can use formats like PDFs and SVGs creatively. Since these are widely used and trusted file types, users often do not think twice before opening them, representing a significant area for security focus.

🔒 Social Engineering: This method emphasizes psychological manipulation instead of technical hacking. Understanding the attacker’s perspective can help organizations develop better training for employees to recognize subtle cues of phishing and social engineering attempts.

🖥️ Physical Media Infiltration: The use of USB drives to bypass network defenses shows that traditional preventive measures, like firewalls, can be inadequate against physical infiltration. This highlights a gap in security strategies that need to address both logical and physical access control.

🔧 Software Updates as a Defense: The urgency for robust software update protocols cannot be overstated. Outdated systems not only leave vulnerabilities unpatched but also represent low-hanging fruit for attackers, which can lead to far-reaching consequences across an organization.

🌐 Risk from Managed Service Providers: Organizations must vet third-party connections, recognizing that an attacker can infiltrate via compromised services. This point drives home the importance of rigorous security vetting for any vendor interactions.

🔗 Network Integrity and Security Protocols: The emphasis on updated wireless security protocols illustrates the evolving threat landscape requiring organizations to stay ahead. Adopting the latest technologies ensures that vulnerabilities inherent in older protocols are mitigated, bolstering both wired and wireless security frameworks effectively.
